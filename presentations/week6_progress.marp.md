## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Onboarding Architecture
```dart
// Smart routing logic
AppStartup {
  - checks hasSeenWelcome flag
  - checks onboardingComplete flag
  - checks user authentication status
  - checks existing pet count (fallback)
  - routes to appropriate screen
}
---
// State management
LocalStorageService {
  - hasSeenWelcome()
  - setHasSeenWelcome()
  - hasCompletedOnboarding()
  - setOnboardingComplete()
  - clearOnboardingData()
}
```

---

## 🛠 Technical Implementation (Continued)

### Enhanced Pet Creation Flow
```dart
// Guided flow integration
EditPetPage {
  - isFirstTimeFlow parameter
  - _currentStep tracking
  - _buildGuidedFlow() vs _buildRegularFlow()
  - Step indicators with completion status
  - Navigation between steps
}

// Success flow
SuccessView {
  - Personalized pet name display
  - Next steps guidance cards
  - Automatic onboarding completion
  - Navigation to dashboard
}
```

## 🎥 Demo Path

1. **Launch app** - Should show Welcome screen with no overflow
2. **Complete onboarding flow**:
   - Welcome → Get Started → Sign Up → Guided Pet Creation → Success → Dashboard
3. **Test returning user** - Close/reopen app, should go directly to dashboard
4. **Test existing user with pets** - Should skip onboarding entirely
