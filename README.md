## 8.1) Phase roadmap (refined)

- **Sprint 1 (Weeks 1‚Äì5):** MVP complete.
- **Sprint 2 (Weeks 6‚Äì10):** Lost mode, weight tracking, directory, polish.
- **Stretch beyond class project:** advanced roles, push alerts, offline sync, trainer/adoption flows.

## 8.2) Phase Roadmap (Beyond Class Project)  
- **Phase 1:** Owner MVP (profiles + reminders + QR share)  
- **Phase 2:** Family / Sitter Sync (multi-user roles, handoff links, task checkoffs)  
- **Phase 3:** Professional extensions (adoption agencies, trainers, groomers/vets)  
- **Phase 4:** Insights & reporting (health logs, exports, analytics)  
- **Phase 5:** Offline cache, advanced notifications, expanded ecosystem  

---

## 9) Success Criteria  
- Sprint 1: One owner can create a pet, add a care plan, get reminders, share QR profile.  
- Sprint 2: **Two linked accounts can see and complete the same care plan in real time.**  
- Long-term: Agencies, trainers, and vets adopt Petfolio as a trusted handoff and coordination tool.  

---

## 10) Risks & Mitigations  
- **Time (4‚Äì6 hrs/week):** keep MVP tight; defer stretch goals.  
- **Sync complexity:** start simple with AccessToken + real-time updates; refine roles later.  
- **Push notifications:** begin with local, layer in FCM once core sync works.  
- **Privacy:** expiring share links, clear opt-in for lost posters, limited role permissions.
