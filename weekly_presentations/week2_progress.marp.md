- Clean, modern login/signup forms
- Loading states with progress indicators
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Smooth navigation between auth screens

### **User Experience**
- User avatar display in app header
- Dropdown menu with user info and sign out
- Automatic redirect to login when not authenticated
- Seamless transition to main app after login

---

## 🚀 **How to Test**

### **User Registration**
1. Navigate to the app (redirects to login)
2. Click "Sign Up" to create new account
3. Enter email, password, and optional display name
4. Submit form and verify user creation in Firestore

### **User Login**
1. Enter credentials on login page
2. Verify successful authentication
3. Check user profile display in header
4. Confirm access to pet management features

---

## 🚀 **How to Test (Continued)**

### **Pet Management**
1. Add a new pet after authentication
2. Verify pet is tied to your user ID
3. Sign out and sign in with different user
4. Confirm you only see your own pets

---


## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Authentication Flow**
```dart
// User signs up → Firebase Auth → Firestore user document
User {
  String id;           // Firebase Auth UID
  String email;        // User email
  String? displayName; // Optional display name
  List<String> roles;  // User roles (default: ['owner'])
  DateTime createdAt;  // Account creation timestamp
}
```

### **Security Implementation**
- **Firestore Rules**: Users can only read/write their own data
- **Pet Ownership**: All pets tied to authenticated user ID
- **Route Protection**: AuthWrapper redirects unauthenticated users

---


### **State Management**
