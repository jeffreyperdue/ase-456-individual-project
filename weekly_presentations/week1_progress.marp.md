# PetLink  
**Cross-Platform Pet Care App**

---

## Problem

- Pet info is scattered across notes, texts, or memory  
- Caregivers risk missing feedings, medications, or details  
- Lost pets lack fast awareness + coordination

---

## Solution

PetLink centralizes pet care:

- **Profiles** with diet, meds, weight, photo  
- **Reminders** via local notifications  
- **Sharing** profiles via link/QR  
- **Lost & Found** alerts with posters  
- **Weight tracking** and trainer directory

---

## Epic Requirement

As a **pet owner**,  
I want to **manage my pet’s information and care needs in one app**,  
so that **I can keep everything organized and share it with others**.
