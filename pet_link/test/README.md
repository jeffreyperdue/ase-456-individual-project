## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
Unit tests focus on individual components and classes in isolation:

- **Domain Models**: Test data validation, serialization, and business logic
- **Services**: Test utility functions, time calculations, and QR code generation
- **Use Cases**: Test business logic and application layer functionality

### Integration Tests
Integration tests verify that multiple components work together correctly:

- **Authentication Workflow**: End-to-end user authentication flows
- **Pet Management Workflow**: Complete pet CRUD operations
- **Care Plan Workflow**: Care plan creation, task generation, and management

### Widget Tests
Widget tests ensure UI components render and behave correctly:

- **App Initialization**: Verify app starts without errors
- **Navigation**: Test basic navigation flows
- **Provider Integration**: Ensure state management works with UI

## Running Tests

### Run All Tests

   - Duration calculations
   - Day-of-week handling

## Test Utilities

### TestDataFactory
Provides factory methods for creating test objects:
```dart
final user = TestDataFactory.createTestUser();
final pet = TestDataFactory.createTestPet();
final carePlan = TestDataFactory.createTestCarePlan();
```

### MockClock
Allows controlling time in tests:
```dart
final mockClock = MockClock();
mockClock.setTime(DateTime(2024, 1, 15, 12, 0));
mockClock.advance(Duration(hours: 2));
```

### TestWidgetWrapper
Wraps widgets with necessary providers for testing:
```dart
await tester.pumpWidget(
  TestWidgetWrapper(
    child: MyWidget(),
    overrides: [myProvider.overrideWithValue(testValue)],
  ),
);
```

## Mock Services

The test suite includes comprehensive mocks for:
- Firebase Authentication
- Firestore Database
- Firebase Storage
- Local Notifications
- Image Picker
- Share Plus
- URL Launcher

## Test Configuration

Tests are configured in `test_config.dart` which:
- Sets up platform channel mocks
- Configures test timeouts
- Handles test environment setup and cleanup

## Best Practices

1. **Test Isolation**: Each test is independent and doesn't rely on other tests
2. **Descriptive Names**: Test names clearly describe what is being tested
3. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Tests follow the AAA pattern for clarity
4. **Mock External Dependencies**: External services are mocked for reliable testing
5. **Edge Cases**: Tests cover both happy paths and error scenarios
6. **Time Control**: Time-dependent tests use MockClock for deterministic behavior

## Adding New Tests

When adding new features:

1. **Create unit tests** for domain models and services
2. **Add integration tests** for workflow scenarios
3. **Include widget tests** for new UI components
4. **Update test utilities** if new test data factories are needed
5. **Mock new external dependencies** in `test_config.dart`

## Continuous Integration

The test suite is designed to run in CI environments:
- All tests are deterministic and don't rely on external services
- Platform channels are properly mocked
- Tests complete within reasonable timeouts
- Coverage reports are generated for monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Platform Channel Errors**: Ensure `test_config.dart` is imported and `setupTestEnvironment()` is called
2. **Provider Errors**: Use `TestWidgetWrapper` with proper provider overrides
3. **Time-dependent Tests**: Use `MockClock` for consistent time-based testing
4. **Async Operations**: Use proper `await` and `Future.delayed()` for async testing

### Debug Tips

- Use `flutter test --verbose` for detailed test output
- Add `print()` statements for debugging test flow
- Use `tester.pumpAndSettle()` to wait for animations to complete
- Check provider state with `container.read(provider)` in tests
