# About Petfolio

Petfolio is a cross-platform pet care application built with Flutter, designed to solve coordination challenges in pet care management.

## The Problem

Pet owners face numerous coordination difficulties when managing pet care across multiple caregivers:

- No single source of truth for pet information, diet, medical history, and care routines
- Fragmented communication between owners, family, and sitters
- Complex handoffs when transferring pet care responsibilities temporarily
- Missed medications or feedings due to lack of coordination
- Emergency situations without quick access to critical pet data

## The Solution

Petfolio provides a unified platform that:

- **Synchronizes care plans** in real-time across all caregivers
- **Manages role-based access** with secure, time-limited permissions
- **Simplifies handoffs** with QR codes and shareable links
- **Centralizes information** in one trusted location
- **Supports emergency situations** with lost pet alerts and auto-generated posters
